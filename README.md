# Explanation of creation: 
I first created the backend infrastructure on AWS with Terraform. Using Infrastructure-as-Code is much more efficient instead of building the backend on the AWS console.

Within my Terraform code I bootstrapped my EC2 instances created by my Auto Scaling Group. Within my user data is a bash script that installs Apache, the efs utils, and WordPress. From there I configred my WordPress files to be held in EFS and the data to be help in AWS RDS with a MySQL engine. 

I created new DNS records to make WordPress use my own custom domain. The site forces HTTPS to be used with TLS protocols.
